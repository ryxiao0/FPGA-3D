INFO: [Coretcl 2-1500] The part has been set to 'xc7s50csga324-1' for the current project only. Run set_part -help for more details. To evaluate different speed grades in the current design, use the set_speed_grade command, or use the open_checkpoint -part command to change the part used by an existing checkpoint design.
